	<article><p>My name is Valerie Sou. I am a F4 student in Sacred Heart Canossian College (English Section). I will be studying science for the upcoming years, and I am thrilled to enter a university and study for my future career.</p>
		<p>At this moment, I am still finding my true passion for my future pathway, even if itâ€™s a difficult and tough task, I will still do my best to achieve my dream and compassion.</p>
		<p> I have many habits and interests such as drawing and playing the drum, I am specifically fond of drawing and it has become my favourite hobby.</p>
